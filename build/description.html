<h1 id="main-heading">HTML-Demos Homepage (GitHub Pages)</h1>

<pre>

The HTML for this page is generated in <a href="https://github.com/scarletti-ben/html-demos/blob/main/build/build.py"><code>build.py</code></a> via <a href="https://github.com/scarletti-ben/html-demos/actions/workflows/static.yml"><code>GitHub Actions</code></a>, which are configured in the custom workflow file <a href="https://github.com/scarletti-ben/html-demos/actions/workflows/static.yml"><code>static.yml</code></a>. The <code>build.py</code> script generates links to all <code>index.html</code> files in the <code>demos</code> folder, and its subdirectories, allowing the project to grow exponentially without need for manually adding each link to the body of the root <code>index.html</code>.

Because the root <code>index.html</code> is built and not written, it is not tracked by the repository to avoid need for extra syncing. It seems to be inaccessible via <code>GitHub</code>.

The reason <code>build.py</code> is needed is that sites hosted on <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a> do not offer easy directory access and rely on relative or absolute links to sites in the site structure.

If testing locally, this page is not needed, you can instead set up a local server via <code>python -m http.server</code> in the <code>demos</code> folder. Doing so opens <code>demos</code> as a directory and will give easy access to all demo sites.
